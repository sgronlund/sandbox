# sandbox
This is my sandbox for playing around like one use to do. This is mainly for software development related tasks but other things may occur. 
## structure
The idea behind this repository is as follows. 
1. Each thing explored is one directory.
2. Each directory of the aforementioned type contains a markdown file called `notes.md` which can be considered a very unstructured writeup of the area explored.
3. Each area and the code for it should be easily reproducible
4. If an idea grows to large or if the amibition is a bit higher it will be migrated to a seperate repository
